    <legend><h2>What is Data Structure?</h2></legend>
    <p>Look around you! The whole world revolves around information and data. As a result, data and
         information are integral to daily life.
        <br><br>
        However, that data must be stored somewhere where it can be easily accessed and processed.
        <br><br>
        That's where Data Structures come into the picture! 
        <br><br>
        Data Structure is a systematic process of organizing and storing the data in the main memory
         of the computer so that it can be managed properly and utilized efficiently. <br>
         One common example of data structure is a LinkedIn List. </p>
